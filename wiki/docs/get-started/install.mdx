## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have both `git` and `curl` installed on your system.

### Installation Steps

1. Ensure you are in your home directory.
2. Confirm that the prerequisites are installed.
3. Open your terminal (or TTY) and run:

<pre>cd && git clone --depth=1 <ProjectRepoUrl/> && cd MyDE && bash .\/init</pre>

This command will clone the MyDE repository to `~/MyDE`, install dependencies, and set up all configurations.
